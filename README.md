# Smooth-Dragon
WebGL project using ThreeJS, Javascript and HTML5 for exploring several computer-graphics techniques: mesh creation, texture UVs mapping, lighting and shadows, bump mapping, surface smoothing, and User Interface (widgets).

This WebGL app can be visualized in github pages because is a "front-end" only (all models have been converted to data structures and stored in JS files for loading easyly).
